                  <p class="card-text">The Great Backwaters of Kerala is a phenomenon that has held travellers in awe since time eternal. But no amount of reading, Googling or watching videos will ever prepare one for the experience of floating along the green waters in a boat.

                    That first wobble of the boat as you step on board, the gentle lullaby of the lapping waters, the way the rich greenery of Mother Nature envelops you, as you settle down on the boat… A cruise on the backwaters of Kerala is one of those rare experiences that move you in ways more than one..</p>

                  <p class="card-text">It is one of the most popular museums in Alleppey. Built-in the 18th century by the king of Travancore, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, Krishnapuram Palace is quite popular for its vintage architecture and artistic murals.

                    Currently maintained by the Archaeological Department of Kerala, the palace is also home to the biggest mural painting of Kerala-- the 'Gajendra Moksha.’ The enriching mural painting covers an area of about 53 km, making this palace one of the most popular places to visit in Alleppey. </p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Karumadi</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">village situated just a few kilometers from Alappuzha or Alleppey, Karumady or Karumadi is one of the amazing Alappuzha tourist places that explorers would love. The place plays a pivotal role in the history and development of Buddhism as a religion and is perhaps best known for the black granite statue of Sri Buddha. 

                    What makes this statue even more alluring is the fact that the left-hand side of this Sri Buddha Statue is missing. Several travelers, especially the ones who are gravely ill or have someone who is ill, come to this village and touch the feet of this Lord Buddha statue because is believed that the statue has healing powers which can be directly transferred to the healer or the victim. </p>

                  <p class="card-text">Pandavan Rock is an amalgamation of breathtaking caves and glorious rock carvings. The natural beauty surrounding this site is bliss. It is said that the Pandavas stayed inside the cave during Mahabharata.

                    Thus, it is one of the best places to see in Alleppey. It is also quite famous as a picnic spot. The route to the caves is easy but elder people should avoid the trail, in case they suffer from health problems. The rock caves are adjoined by the Kallada Dam, which is a tourist attraction as well. .</p>
