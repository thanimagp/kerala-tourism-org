                  <p class="card-text">A stroll through the lanes of Fort Kochi will definitely attract you to the rustic and old-fashioned neighbourhood of Mattancherry. It is said that back in the days, this cheri (street), was lined with mutton butchers, and so it ended up being called “Muttoncherry” which over the years evolved into “Mattancherry”. Today the place exhibits centuries-old architectures and various social and cultural imprints left behind by foreigners. Declared as a heritage site by the government, Mattancherry has been an inspiration to historians, film-makers, travellers and artistes alike. Amongst all the Ernakulam tourist places, this museum is one of the most prominent attractions.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">One of the first bird sanctuaries in Kerala and undeniably a haven for nature enthusiasts. In the words of Salim Ali (world famous ornithologist), Thattekkad is the “richest bird sanctuary in India” since it is home to hundreds of different endangered species of migratory birds. This thick deciduous forest has plantations of mahogany, teak, rosewood and rubber running through it. Make sure to bring along a pair of binoculars to get a glimpse of the birdlife. The best time to visit would be between November and March. </p>
